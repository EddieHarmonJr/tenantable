# Tenantable

Tenantable is a platform designed to give a voice to tenants and provide a valuable resource to would-be tenants in the future. People desire to love the habitat in which they choose to live. So, before moving to a place (that you don't know much about aside from photos), wouldn't it be great if you had a pathway to the actual rental community that already resides there to get valuable, insightful feedback so that you can make a high-quality, informed decision? That is where Tenantable steps in.

# How Does It Work?

Tenantable allows users to create an account on the platform and leave reviews, add "proof" photos regarding the condition of their building, and give constructive criticism about their landlords and their ownership performance.

Apartment seekers can utilize the platform by engaging directly with tenants who already dwell in the spaces that they wish to live, and gain clarity on whether moving to that location is a wise, informed choice. The value is astronomical, as it has the potential to spare would-be-renters the painful mistake of being legally bound to leases in apartments in which they do not wish to live; yet it is too late due to 1-2 year leasing agreements. Apartment hunters can search by property, by landlord, or by specific tenant to obtain a wholistic overview of what the building is actually like, directly from those impacted by it. They can interact with those connected to the building via email, phone, or even a tour (all at the personal discretion of the account holder).

Tenantable's aim is to foster dialogue between renters and prospective renters, as well as "rentors" (landlords) and "rentees" (tenants). Good landlords, who prioritize people above profits, should be rewarded with more tenants. While "slumlords" who run unsafe, unclean, and unfair buildings and do not take care of their properties, should be divested and have individuals who seek nothing but a comfortable home, steered away from their buildings to "greener pastures". Tenants who reside in such buildings can use Tenantable to have a voice, and participate in grassroots community organizing in order to band together with others in their communities facing the same circumstances.
