                <p>We believe that tenants should receive fair housing conditions. Conditions that help individuals and families thrive, not just survive. You should not have to literally win the lottery in order to have affordable housing. While everyone won’t be able to live in a luxurious penthouse, or a “deluxe apartment in the sky” like they may want, everyone needs to be able to have a safe, healthy, affordable place to lay their heads <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html" target="_blank">(just ask Maslow…)</a></p>

                <p>And when those rights are violated, Tenantable provides the platform for individuals to allow their voices to be heard, to form a community and mobilize to combat unfair housing practices and to be a beacon of light to unassuming, would-be-renters, to rescue them from making similar missteps of unwittingly empowering a slumlord.</p>
